# Battle-Squad

# What is this project?

This project is a squad building simulator, where you can make a squad of fighters with different skills, weapons and armour.

# How did I expect the project to go? And how did it go?

The project was pretty easy at the start, jira and git were easy to use and setting up my API and testing were fine. Once I started to try and add more tables to my project this is where everything became a lot more harder and in the end was unable to implement it.

# How can it be improved?

For this project to get improved, it could do with another table being added so more than one squad could be made and stored.
